# Not all Data Scientists are scientists
Before I start, here is my disclaimer. The following are my personal opinions about teh title data scientist. I don't mean to be neither judgmental nor discriminated.

I think the title of Data Scientist is inflated quite a bit nowaday. This maybe biased because English is not my native language. In Chinese, the titles with suffix "學家" (similar to Englisg suffix "-ist" in scientist or "-ian" in statistician), are for people who delicate into novel research to expand the human's knowledge frontier. Here are some examples:
- 科學家 scientist
- 物理學家 physicist
- 化學家 chemist
- 思想家 ideolohist
- 統計學家 statistician
- 數學家 mathematician

On the other hand, for the professionals who are experts doing something based on what we already know, they are called with titles with suffix "師". For example:
- 工程師 engineer
- 設計師 desiner
- 雕刻師 sculpturer
- 烘培師 baker

I have a higher standard for myself. Even if I have a data science job, I don't think myself automatically enetitled as a data scientist. Therefore, I decided to start this master program to polish my knowledge and skillset to be qualified as one true data **scientist**.
