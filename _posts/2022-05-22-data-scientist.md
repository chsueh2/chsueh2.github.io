# My 2¢
Before I start, here is my disclaimer. The following are my personal opinions about the title data scientist. I don't mean to be neither judgmental nor discriminated.

## Not All Data Scientists are Scientists
I think the title of Data Scientist is inflated quite a bit nowaday. This maybe biased because English is not my native language. In Chinese, the titles with suffix "學家" (similar to Englisg suffix "-ist" in scientist or "-ian" in statistician), are for people who dedicate into novel research to expand the human's knowledge frontier. Here are some examples:
- 科學家 scientist
- 物理學家 physicist
- 化學家 chemist
- 思想家 ideolohist
- 統計學家 statistician
- 數學家 mathematician

On the other hand, for the professionals who are experts doing something based on what we already know, their titles are emphasized by the suffix "師". For example:
- 工程師 engineer
- 設計師 desiner
- 雕刻師 sculpturer
- 烘培師 baker

Therefore, I have a higher standard for myself. Even if I have a data science job, I don't automatically attribute myself as a data scientist. Thus, I decided to start this master program to polish my knowledge and skillset to be qualified as a true data **scientist**. Without them, I would always think myself as a data science engineer instead.

## Data Scientist vs. Statistician
- The similarity, mentioned above, is their delication to pioneer the field of data to capitalize on the information it provides. 
- The difference is their approach:
  - Statisticians focus on developing new algorithms and/or improve the existing ones. A large part of their practice revolves around very specific strands of methodolgy tailored to best collect and devlop understanding.
  - Data scientists differ in that their field is much larger; they focus on extracting data to build not just a narrative but a devloped insight. Additionally, data science requires a vaster, more extensive range of comprehensive scientific methods.

Taking a step back, both the data scientist and the statistician are  incredible academic and applied benefactors in the world of data science. Regardless, these occupations are equally powerful in the changing metasphere of modern information.
